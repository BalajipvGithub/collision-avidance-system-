# collision-avidance-system-
The Collision Avoidance System using Arduino Uno detects obstacles with ultrasonic sensors and alerts the driver using a buzzer and LEDs. If no response is detected, the system automatically reduces speed. A spring system minimizes damage during a collision, and a camera module captures images, sending them to a pre-defined number for safety.
